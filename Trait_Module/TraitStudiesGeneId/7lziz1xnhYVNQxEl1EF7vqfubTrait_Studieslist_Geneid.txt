Kernal Development	Zea mays	Developmental changes in transcriptomes of two key transfer tissues in maize kernels	Transcriptome profiles of two transfer tissues namely, Maternal Transfer Zone (MATZ) and Basal Endosperm Transfer Layer (BETL) were compared across three stages of development. Sugars and other nutrients unloaded from vascular tissues in the MATZ are imported by the BETL for utilization by the developing endosperm. RNAseq data were obtained from duplicate tissue samples isolated from developing maize kernels at three developmental time points; 8 days post-pollination (DAP), 14 DAP and 20 DAP.

Hormonal Regulation	Zea mays	Examination of plant response specificity to jasmonate analog 10-OPEA (10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid) in maize	As signals, jasmonates (12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA) and its derivattives) have related yet distinct roles in the regulation of plant resistance against insect and pathogen attack. A parallel pathway  leads to the production of 10-oxo-11-phytoenoic acid (10-OPEA). Despite structural similarity to jasmonates, physiological roles for 10-OPEA have remained unclear. Both jasmonic acid 12-OPDA and 10-OPEA equally promote the transcription of numerous defense genes encoding glutathione S-transferases, cytochrome P450s, and pathogenesis-related proteins; however, 10-OPEA activity diverges in the context of reduced protease inhibitor transcript accumulation. To identify additional differential responses, RNAseq was performed for further examination of plant response specificity to the 10-OPEA. A total of 12 samples were analyzed, comprised of two treatments (10-OPEA and 12-OPDA) and a DMSO carrier control (5%DMSO/0.1%Tween 20 in H20), all in replicates of four.

Biotic Stress	Zea mays	In planta expression profiles of five Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFC) isolates in maize	The five Fusarium fujikuroi species complex (FFC) strains analyzed are able to penetrate maize roots and grow invasively, the efficiency of this growth as well as the ability to subsequently grow in other parts of maize plants differ significantly. To gain insight into these differences, the transcriptome of the five isolates in infected maize roots by a RNA sequencing approach was examined. Root samples were taken 4, 10 and 20 days post infection (dpi) for RNA isolation. In addition, the maize gene expression of uninfected seedlings (sample 21) was compared with maize gene expression in response to infection by the five isolates.

Endosperm Development	Zea mays	Role of endosperm-specific transcription factors for storage compounds synthesis in maize kernels	The goals of this study are to study the regulatory network of the two maize endosperm-specific transcription factors opaque2 (O2) and PBF by 16-DAP endosperm transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of their mutants and wild type. The results utilize the expression pattern of global genes regulated by PBF and O2 to elucidate their control for storage compounds synthesis in maize kernels. The 16-DAP endosperm transcriptome of  wild type (WT) and mutants including opaque2, PbfRNAi and PbfRNAi;o2 were generated by RNA-seq with three biological replicates per genotype.

Embryo Development	Zea mays	Transcriptome during early embryo development in maize	Using RNA-seq, the allelic gene expression patterns of maize embryos from reciprocal crosses between inbred lines B73 and Mo17 at six time points (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13 days after pollination) were analyzed. Three biological replicates were performed for each  sample. Reference: GSE95399 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE95399)	MAIZE_embryo-development_GSE95399.txt	GRMZM5G876146
C4 Leaf Development	Oryza sativa	Rice leaf primordia development	Transcriptomic analysis of the early stages of rice leaf development to gain insight into gene expression changes occurring during the earliest phase of acquisition of photosynthetic competence.  RNA samples in triplicates were sampled from Plastochron 3, 4 and 5 stage. In P3 stage, an elongated conical shape structure completely encloses the shoot apical meristem. The subsequent P4 stage is characterized by a phase of rapid elongation of the leaf blade and visible greening of the tissue. At P5 stage, the distal tip of the leaf starts to protrude from the sheaths of older leaves, being pushed up by rapid elongation of the more proximal sheath.

C4 Leaf Development	Zea mays	Maize leaf primordia development	To provide a broader insight into the regulation of Kranz differentiation, a genome‐wide comparative analysis of developmental trajectories in Kranz (foliar leaf blade) and non‐Kranz (husk leaf sheath) leaves of the C4 plant (maize) was performed. In both foliar and husk samples, P1 and P2 primordia comprise cytoplasmically dense cells that lack vacuoles, and procambium associated with the mid‐vein is barely visible. By P4, however, the mid‐vein and developing lateral veins may be distinguished, and the distance between them is already smaller in foliar primordia than in husk primordia. At P5, foliar primordia have initiated intermediate veins and the bauplan of Kranz anatomy is apparent. In contrast, intermediate veins are not formed in husk primordia. Vein spacing does not change after P5, and, as such, both foliar immature (FI) and foliar expanded (FE) leaf blades exhibit the classical cellular arrangement associated with Kranz anatomy (V–BS–M–M–BS–V).

C4 Leaf Development	Zea mays	Functioning of two photosynthetic cells of maize leaf	To investigate the transcriptional network that is associated with the development of C4 photosynthesis, molecular surveys were conducted to profile gene expression in isolated cells from the ­bundle sheath and mesophyll. RNA was amplified from ­bundle sheath and mesophyll cell populations isolated by laser-­capture microdissection (LCM) from the mature zone (tip) samples.

C4 Leaf Development	Zea mays	Maize leaf development gradient	To investigate the transcriptional network that is associated with the development of C4 photosynthesis, molecular surveys were conducted to capture progressive stages of photosynthetic differentiation from individual leaves using Illumina sequencing to profile gene expression along this gradient. Four representative zones of the leaf blade were selected for deeper transcriptomic analysis. These included a basal zone (base, 1 cm above the leaf three ligule, sink tissue), a transitional zone (−1 cm, 1 cm below the leaf two ligule, undergoing the sink-source transition), a maturing zone (+4 cm, 4 cm above the leaf two ligule) and mature zone (tip, + 1 cm below the leaf three tip, fully differentiated and active C 4 photosynthetic zones).

Nitrogen use Efficiency	Sorghum bicolor	Sorghum transcriptome to understand responses to nitrogen sources	For the nitrogen source study, plants grown under differing nitrogen source regimes were harvested at 30 DAE, and shoots and roots were flash frozen. The experiment included two control conditions (one fully fertilized and another with no additional nitrogen), and three nitrogen sources namely, ammonia, nitrate and urea.

Internode Development	Sorghum bicolor	Development and expansion of vegetative stem internodes of sorghum	Bioenergy sorghum accumulates 75% of shoot biomass in stem internodes, which are formed during vegetative growth and elongate in response to developmental and environmental signals. To identify genes and molecular mechanisms that modulate the extent of internode growth, transcriptomic analysis of four successive sub-apical vegetative internodes, representing different stages of internode development of the bioenergy sorghum genotype R.07020, was done. Sampling done in triplicates. References:Kebrom et al., Biotechnol Biofuels 2017;10:159;GSE98817	Sbi_internode_development_GenLvl.txt	Sobic.001G009900
Tillering	Sorghum bicolor	Transcriptome of Tiller Buds in the First Leaf Axil of Phytochrome-B mutant of sorghum	Phytochrome B (phyB) enables plants to modify shoot branching (tillering) and the latter is is inhibited in sorghum genotypes that lack phytochrome B (58M, phyB-1) until after floral initiation. The growth of tiller buds in the first leaf axil of wild-type (100M, PHYB) and phyB-1 sorghum genotypes is similar until 6 d after planting when buds of phyB-1 arrest growth, while wild-type buds continue growing and develop into tillers. RNA-seq libraries were prepared in triplicates from tiller buds in the first leaf axil of phyB-1 and wild-type sorghum at 6 DAP (Days After Planting), 7 DAP and 8 DAP.
